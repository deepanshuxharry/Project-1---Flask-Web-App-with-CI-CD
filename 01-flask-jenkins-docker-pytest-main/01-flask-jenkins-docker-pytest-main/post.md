🚀 **Automated CI/CD for Flask using Jenkins & Docker – Completed!**

Just wrapped up a hands-on project where I set up a **complete CI/CD pipeline** to automate testing, containerization, and deployment of a Flask web application — using:

🔧 **Tech Stack**

* Jenkins for CI/CD automation
* Pytest for unit testing
* Docker for packaging & deployment
* Flask (Python) as the web backend
* GitHub for source code versioning

🛠️ **How It Works**
The Jenkins pipeline automatically:
1️⃣ Cleans workspace
2️⃣ Pulls the latest code from GitHub
3️⃣ Installs Python dependencies
4️⃣ Runs unit tests with Pytest
5️⃣ Builds a Docker image
6️⃣ Stops old container
7️⃣ Deploys the new container with updated code

🧪 **Test coverage** includes routes like `/`, `/health`, and `/api/users`.

🗂️ Clean code, structured folders, and logging utilities make this project a perfect template for **Flask + Jenkins CI/CD beginners**.

💡 This project taught me a lot about **automating deployment workflows**, and I'd love to hear how others are using Jenkins with containerized Python apps!
